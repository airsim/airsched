	  C++ Simulated Airline Schedule Manager Library

\section sec_synopsis SYNOPSIS

\code
#include <airtsp/...>
\endcode

\section sec_description DESCRIPTION

AirTSP aims at providing a clean API and a simple implementation, as
a C++ library, of a Airline Schedule Management System. It is intended
to be used in simulated environments only: it is not designed to work
in the real-world of Airline IT operations.

AirTSP makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

The library covers the following areas:
- Network/graph generation
- Calculation of travel solutions from airline schedules/networks
- Flight-preiods: storage, engine, management
