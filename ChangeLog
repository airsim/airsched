* Mon Dec 05 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora@m4x.org> 0.1.4
- [Dev] The BOM sample tree is no longer built when not invoking explicitly
the built-in option of the (AIRSCHED_Service) API.
- [Build] Improved the CMake build framework. For instance, the package
versions are now correctly handled, for the simulator-related components, as
well as for third-party libraries (e.g., Xapian, SOCI, Boost). The
rpath/run-path is now inserted into the (library, executable) binaries (only
when needed, though).
- [Build] Removed any support for the GNU Autotools.

* Fri Nov 04 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora@m4x.org> 0.1.3
- The code is now compatible with g++ 4.1 and Boost 1.33.

* Wed Oct 26 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora@m4x.org> 0.1.2
- Updated the CMake build macros, so as to support CMake-2.6 (and not only
CMake-2.8).

* Sat Aug 20 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis.arnaud_fedora@m4x.org> 0.1.1
- Just added a small description within the README file.
- Took into account the feedback from the review request (bug #732205).

* Sat Aug 20 2011 Denis Arnaud <denis_arnaud at users dot sourceforge.net> 0.1.0
- First release. AirSched is able to calculate travel solutions for any
incoming booking request, thanks to the batch (airsched). An interactive
utility has still to be implemented.
