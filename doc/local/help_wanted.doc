<b>Do not ask what AirTSP can do for you. Ask what you can do for
AirTSP.</b>

You can help us to develop the AirTSP library. There are always a
lot of things you can do:

- Start using AirTSP
- Tell your friends about AirTSP and help them to get started using it  
- If you find a bug, report it to us. Without your help we can never
  hope to produce a bug free code.
- Help us to improve the documentation by providing information about
  documentation bugs 
- Answer support requests in the AirTSP discussion forums on
  SourceForge. If you know the answer to a question, help others to
  overcome their AirTSP problems.
- Help us to improve our algorithms. If you know of a better way
  (e.g. that is faster or requires less memory) to implement some of our
  algorithms, then let us know.
- Help us to port AirTSP to new platforms. If you manage to compile
  AirTSP on a new platform, then tell us how you did it.
- Send us your code. If you have a good AirTSP compatible code,
  which you can release under the LGPLv2.1, and you think it should be
  included in AirTSP, then send it to us.
- Become an AirTSP developer. Send us an e-mail and tell what you
  can do for AirTSP.
